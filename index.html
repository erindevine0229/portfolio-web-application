            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Erin DeVine. I’m originally from Boston, MA. I moved to Richmond, VA two years ago for the warmer weather and new job opportunities. I enjoy cooking, hiking and playing board games with friends and family. My husband and I have a lab-mix named “Auggie the Doggie” and we love taking him for walks in new places. My bucket list goal is to visit all of the national parks within the USA.<br>
    
            <br>I’m currently a Registered Dietitian, working with preterm infants and newborns in the Neonatal ICU. I am enrolled in the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp in pursuit of a career change. I was drawn to coding for the ability to help people through problem solving and the many different career paths available. I am organized, hard-working and have attention to detail when it comes to the desired products for my clients. I am committed to life-long learning and I bring to the table a diverse work history which helps inform my process from a user perspective and not just a developer.<br>
            
            <br>This website can be used to view my current body of work in web development. I will continue to add projects here and to my GitHub page, linked below! Please feel free to contact me using any of the included platforms below. I'd love to make connections and hear about career oppotunities.
