# Portfolio Web Application

## Description
The purpose was to create a portfolio website structured and styled similarly to a model. The HTML and CSS were created from scratch to mimic the model template. This website includes hover effects to indicate mouse positioning for several elements as well as functional links in both the navigation bar (automatically scrolling to corresponding sections on the webpage) and the contact section (linking to external sites). The site will be updated as projects are completed and the photo/icons will be updated to link to these projects. Below are attached the target template design and the design of my site for comparison.
